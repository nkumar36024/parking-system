        <p>
          Stack Parking System is the economical and simple parking solution for new buildings or existing societies where parking can be doubled.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is designed to be fit on the surface and double the car space by stacking the cars one above the other. The car must be driven off before the upper platform is lowered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stack parking system is designed to park cars of different heights as per the height availability at customer's location. It is perfect for the residential, commercial projects and parking garages where vertical stacking of the cars is desired.
